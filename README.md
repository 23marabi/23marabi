### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a technology enthusiast with some experience with multiple programming languages and technologies. My main languages are `Python` & `Rust`, but I also know some `C/C++`, `Lua`, `GML`, and `GDscript`. Some of the technologies that I've worked with are `Arduino`, `RaspberryPi`, and `Linux`. I've experimented with several Linux distros, but my main distro is `arch`. I also have experience with `First Robotics`, and am on the Robotics team at my school. Even though I'm not that good at programming, I enjoy it and enjoy learning new technologies.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [rust-chess](https://github.com/23marabi/rust-chess) and [useful-bot](https://github.com/23marabi/useful-bot)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning `Rust`, `discord.py`, & `BootstrapStudio`
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything really.
